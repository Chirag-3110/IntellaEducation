        C++ is a cross-platform language that is basically used to produce superior applications, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.<br><br>
            C++ provides programmers a high level of management over system resources and memory. Certificate course in C++ is a certification course that is of few months to one year length.<br><br>
            C++ is a general purpose artificial language and widely used currently these days for competitive programming. it's imperative, object-oriented and generic programming options. 
            C++ runs on voluminous platforms like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac etc. <br><br>
            <b>1. C++ is very close to hardware, so you get a chance to work at a low level which gives you lot of control in terms of memory management, better performance and finally a robust software development.</b><br><br>
            <b>2. C++ programming gives you a clear understanding about Object Oriented Programming. You will understand low level implementation of polymorphism when you will implement virtual tables and virtual table pointers, or dynamic type identification.</b><br><br>
            <b>3. C++ is one of the every green programming languages and loved by millions of software developers. If you are a great C++ programmer then you will never sit without work and more importantly you will get highly paid for your work.</b><br><br>
            <b>4. C++ is the most widely used programming languages in application and system programming. So you can choose your area of interest of software development.</b><br><br>
            <b>5. C++ really teaches you the difference between compiler, linker and loader, different data types, storage classes, variable types their scopes etc.</b><br><br>
            There are 1000s of good reasons to learn C++ Programming. But one thing for sure, to learn any programming language, not only C++, 
            you just need to code, and code and finally code until you become expert.

        about: `
            A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data. There are several basic and advanced types 
            of data structures, all designed to arrange data to suit a specific purpose. Data structures make it easy for users to access and work with 
            the data they need in appropriate ways. Most importantly, data structures frame the organization of information so that machines and humans 
            can better understand it.<br><br>
            In computer science and computer programming, a data structure may be selected or designed to store data for the purpose of using it with 
            various algorithms. In some cases, the algorithm's basic operations are tightly coupled to the data structure's design. Each data structure 
            contains information about the data values, relationships between the data and -- in some cases -- functions that can be applied to the data.<br><br>
            Data structures are the building blocks for more sophisticated applications. They are designed by composing data elements into a logical unit 
            representing an abstract data type that has relevance to the algorithm or application. An example of an abstract data type is a "customer name" 
            that is composed of the character strings for "first name," "middle name" and "last name."<br><br>
            A good algorithm usually comes together with a set of good data structures that allow the algorithm to manipulate the data efficiently. In this 
            online course, we consider the common data structures that are used in various computational problems. You will learn how these data structures 
            are implemented in different programming languages and will practice implementing them in our programming assignments. This will help you to 
            understand what is going on inside a particular built-in implementation of a data structure and what to expect from it. You will also learn 
            typical use cases for these data structures.<br><br>

            Java is among the top computer languages used for web, mobile, desktop applications, etc. It is a programming language based on the concept of Object-Oriented Programming Systems 
            (OOPS). Programming enthusiasts can learn Java to upscale their skills and knowledge. After the entire Java Web application directory structure. Let’s explore what is included in 
            the advanced, framework and core java syllabus and curriculum.<br><br> 
            The word Core describes the basic concept of something, and here, the phrase 'Core Java' defines the basic Java that covers the basic concept of Java programming language. 
            We all are aware that Java is one of the well-known and widely used programming languages, and to begin with it, the beginner has to start the journey with Core Java and 
            then towards the Advance Java. The Java programming language is a general-purpose programming language that is based on the OOPs concept. The ocean of Java is too deep to 
            learn, i.e., as much you learn more, you will know its depth. Java is a platform-independent and robust programming language. The principle followed by Java is WORA that 
            says Write Once, Run Anywhere. The programming language is quite simple and easy to understand. But one should know that Core Java is not different from Java. Java is 
            complete in itself, but for the beginners, it is natural that the beginner must begin with the core concepts of Java. In actual, Java has different editions, where Core 
            Java is one of the parts of an edition.<br><br>
            <b>Concepts Covered in Core Java</b><br><br>

            this tutorial you will find yourself at a moderate level of expertise in Android programming from where you can take yourself to next levels.<br><br>
            Android programming is based on Java programming language so if you have basic understanding on Java programming then it will be a fun to 
            learn Android application development.<br><br>
            Android applications are usually developed in the Java language using the Android Software Development Kit.<br><br>
            Once developed, Android applications can be packaged easily and sold out either through a store such as Google Play, SlideME, Opera Mobile Store, 
            Mobango, F-droid and the Amazon Appstore.<br><br>
            Android powers hundreds of millions of mobile devices in more than 190 countries around the world. It's the largest installed base of any 
            mobile platform and growing fast. Every day more than 1 million new Android devices are activated worldwide.<br><br>
            This tutorial has been written with an aim to teach you how to develop and package Android application. We will start from environment 
            setup for Android application programming and then drill down to look into various aspects of Android applications.
