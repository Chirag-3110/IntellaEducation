            SOLIDWORKS is used by millions of designers and engineers at hundreds of thousands of companies. It’s one of the most popular design and engineering software on the market. 
            Known for its range of features and high functionality, SOLIDWORKS is used across multiple professions and industries around the world.<br><br>
            SOLIDWORKS uses parametric design, which is why it’s such an effective tool for designers and engineers. This means that the designer can see how changes will
            affect its neighboring components, or even the overall solution. For example, if the size of a single component is increased, this would affect the joint or 
            hole it’s attached to. This allows designers to spot and correct issues quickly and easily.<br><br>
            <b>SOLIDWORKS Features</b><br><br>
            <b>1. Simple but sophisticated 3D CAD design</b><br><br>
            <b>2. Use templates and the CAD library for improved efficiency</b><br><br>
            <b>3. Automation and design reuse to speed up the process</b><br><br>
            <b>4. Cost estimation tools allow you to keep track in real-time</b><br><br>

            Ethical hacking is an authorized practice of detecting vulnerabilities in an application, system, or organization’s infrastructure and bypassing system security to identify potential data breaches and threats in a network. Ethical hackers aim to investigate the system or network for weak points that malicious hackers 
            can exploit or destroy. They can improve the security footprint to withstand attacks better or divert them.<br><br>
            The company that owns the system or network allows Cyber Security engineers to perform such activities in order to test the system’s defenses. Thus, unlike malicious hacking, this

            Data science is the study of data to extract meaningful insights for business. It is a multidisciplinary approach that combines principles and practices from the fields 
            of mathematics, statistics, artificial intelligence, and computer engineering to analyze large amounts of data. This analysis helps data scientists to 
            ask and answer questions like what happened, why it happened, what will happen, and what can be done with the results.<br><br>
            Data science is important because it combines tools, methods, and technology to generate meaning from data. Modern organizations are inundated with data; there is a 
            proliferation of devices that can automatically collect and store information. Online systems and payment portals capture more data in the fields of e-commerce, medicine, 
            finance, and every other aspect of human life. We have text, audio, video, and image data available in vast quantities.<br><br>
            While the term data science is not new, the meanings and connotations have changed over time. The word first appeared in the ’60s as an alternative name for statistics. 
            In the late ’90s, computer science professionals formalized the term. A proposed definition for data science saw it as a separate field with three aspects: data design, 
            collection, and analysis. It still took another decade for the term to be used outside of academia.<br><br>
            Artificial intelligence and machine learning innovations have made data processing faster and more efficient. Industry demand has created an ecosystem of courses, 
            degrees, and job positions within the field of data science. Because of the cross-functional skillset and expertise required, data science shows strong projected

            <b>3. C++ is one of the every green programming languages and loved by millions of software developers. If you are a great C++ programmer then you will never sit without work and more importantly you will get highly paid for your work.</b><br><br>
            <b>4. C++ is the most widely used programming languages in application and system programming. So you can choose your area of interest of software development.</b><br><br>
            <b>5. C++ really teaches you the difference between compiler, linker and loader, different data types, storage classes, variable types their scopes etc.</b><br><br>
